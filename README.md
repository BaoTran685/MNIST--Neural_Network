# MNIST Neural Network
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. <br />
This notebook's intention is to build a machine learning model that can predict the number written in the 28 by 28 pixels images. <br />
After using mini-batch gradient descent (part of supervised learning), the model achieves a 97% accuracy rate. <br />
You can see my code to better understand how the model works. <br />
